# DREAMS Location-Proximity Module - Work Summary

## What Was Built

A complete **location-proximity analysis module** for DREAMS that enables multi-dimensional location similarity analysis to understand how semantically similar places influence emotional patterns in recovery journeys.

---

## Project Goal (GSoC 2026)

**"Understanding proximity in locations and emotions through digitized memories"**

Traditional location analysis uses only GPS coordinates. This module goes beyond that to consider:
- Categorical similarity (church ↔ church)
- Linguistic similarity (Portuguese restaurants)
- Cultural similarity (shared cultural context)

---

#### `proximity_calculator.py`
- **Haversine distance**: Geographic proximity
- **Categorical similarity**: Place type matching
- **Linguistic similarity**: Language context
- **Cultural similarity**: Jaccard index of tags
- **Composite proximity**: Weighted combination
- **Proximity matrix**: NxN similarity matrix

#### `emotion_location_mapper.py`
- Maps emotions to locations

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Proximity Formalization

**Formula**:
```
P(L₁, L₂) = α·Pgeo + β·Pcat + γ·Pling + δ·Pcult
```

**Implementation**:
- Geographic: Haversine distance with normalization
- Categorical: Exact match (1.0), related (0.5), different (0.0)
- Linguistic: Binary language matching
- Cultural: Jaccard similarity of tags

**Innovation**: First formalization of multi-dimensional location proximity for emotion analysis

### 2. Emotion-Location Pattern Discovery

**Capabilities**:
- Location sentiment profiles (distribution, dominant emotion)
- Emotional hotspots (≥60% consistent sentiment)
- Place type comparison (aggregate statistics)
- Temporal trends (emotion evolution at locations)

**Use Cases**:
- "Do all churches evoke positive emotions?"
- "Which locations are consistently negative?"
- "How do emotions at hospitals change over time?"

### 3. Semantic Clustering

**Algorithm**: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

**Advantages**:
- No predefined cluster count
- Handles noise/outliers
- Works with proximity matrix

**Output**:
- Cluster assignments
- Emotion distribution per cluster
- Dominant emotion per cluster

**Insight**: "User feels positive at religious places" (category-level analysis)

---

## Demo Results

### Demo 1: Proximity Calculation
```
St. Mary's Church <-> Holy Trinity Church: 0.850
Alaska Native Medical Center <-> Providence Hospital: 0.725
St. Mary's Church <-> Hospital: 0.345
```

**Insight**: Churches cluster together (0.850) despite different locations, while church-hospital proximity is low (0.345)

### Demo 2: Emotion-Location Mapping
```
church_1: 66.7% positive, 33.3% neutral
hospital_1: 100% negative
park_1: 100% positive
```

**Insight**: Clear emotional patterns by place type

### Demo 3: Semantic Clustering
```
Cluster 0: Church A, Church B (same type)
Cluster 1: Hospital A, Hospital B (same type)
Noise: Park A (insufficient similar places)
```

**Insight**: Automatic grouping of semantically similar places
